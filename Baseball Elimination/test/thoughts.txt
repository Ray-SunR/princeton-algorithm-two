This assignment is basically about applying FordFulkerson algorithm. 
Thus, the most important thing here is to construct FlowNetwork graph. As long as the graph is correct, then the FordFulkerson object would tell you the result. 
In the marked array, if an entry is true, it means that entry is in mincut, meaning that this entry is not full. 
A team is not eliminated if and only if all entries are full (all entries are false).
If there is an entry that's true, means this team is eliminated. 

How to determine a team is eliminated by who?
For each true entry, use the index of the marked array to map between the GameBetweenVertex. For example, entry 1 is true and vertex 1 is game between 1 - 2. Thus, the team is eliminated by team 1 and team 2.
